                <p>Greetings, welcome at the Vampire Club. This is a safe place for Vampires all around the world. To us, the most 
                important thing about the club is that we support each other in the Vampire Community. Our club was founded by Dr. Bob 
                Gray in 1897 as a way to reach out to other vampires. Soon, the club became a massive success and as of today we have 
                thousands of members all around the world. Next year, we're even going to host the world's first ever Vampire Con. 
                Check the News section of this website regularly for updates about it. </p>
